\title{Estimates false positive rate at a series of p-value cutoffs}
\usage{
findPvalueCutoff(
  x = NULL,
  thresholds = NULL,
  range = c(0, 1),
  interval = 0.05,
  nsims = 1000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of p-values.}

\item{thresholds}{A vector of manually selected p-value cutoffs at which false positive rate needs to be estimated.}

\item{range}{Limit of lower and upper p-value cutoffs within which false positive rate will be estimated. Default is c(0,1) when thresholds parameter is NULL.}

\item{interval}{Interval used to generate a series of p-values within lower and upper bound given in range porameter. Default is 0.05.}

\item{nsims}{An integer value representing the number of simulated randomized datasets (controlled experiments) to be generated to compute false positive error rate. Default is 1000 but at least 10000 datasets are recommended.}
}
\value{
A named (p-value cutoffs) vector with estimated false positive rate.
}
\description{
Given a p-value vector resulting from differential gene expression analysis, this function estimates false positive error rates expected by random chance at a series of p-value cutoffs
